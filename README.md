## Description

Loop Homes is a user interface that connects seller’s with potential buyers - erasing the middle man and thus erasing some of larger costs of selling your home. A free marketplace where sellers can advertise their properties and interact with buyers of their own choosing, within a timeframe that suits their personal needs and availability. We understand that homeowners are more than capable of finding potential buyers, and we at Loop Homes have given them the platform to do just that…
